This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
version 18.2.1.
## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application
will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You
can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/`
directory.
## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this
command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing
capabilities.

## Description
The chat system is designed to facilitate real-time communication among users,
grouped within designated channels and groups. This system incorporates a tiered
permission structure to accommodate varying levels of administrative control and
access:
### Super Admin:
- Ultimate control over the entire system.
- Can create or delete any groups and channels.
- Manages user roles and permissions across the system.
- Has oversight of all group activities and can intervene in any group or channel if
necessary.
### Group Admin:
- Manages specific groups assigned to them.
- Can add or remove users from their groups.
- Responsible for creating and managing channels within their groups.
- Can moderate discussions and manage group-specific settings.
### User:
- Basic access level intended for general communication.
- Can join channels and participate in discussions as permitted by their group admin.
- Can view and send messages, share files, and engage in video calls within the
channels they have access to.
## Installation Instructions
To set up a project on your local system, follow these steps:
1. Verify that Node.js is installed on the system.
2. Replicate the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/s5273202-
project.git`
. Channel Data Structure (MongoDB Collection: channels)
Each channel is represented by a document in the channels collection. Channels are associated with specific groups, and each channel document stores information about the messages exchanged within that channel, as well as its members. The key fields include:
•	_id: A unique identifier generated by MongoDB for each channel.
•	groupId: A reference to the group that the channel belongs to.
•	name: The name of the channel (e.g., "General Discussion").
•	members: An array of usernames representing users who have joined the channel.
•	messages: An array of message objects, where each message contains:
o	username: The user who sent the message.
o	message: The content of the message.
o	timestamp: The time when the message was sent.
